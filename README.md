# Japan-Analysis
In preparation for my move to Tokyo, I wanted to conduct some descriptive analysis on the market in which I would be entering. This led to me searching through online data repositories on Kaggle to conduct descriptive data analysis on various aspects of Japan; from economic performance to societal wellbeing. This project contains my findings on Japan's society, including economy, social conditions, and various other aspects of Japan.
